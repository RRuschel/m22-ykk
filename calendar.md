# Course Calendar (Topics and due dates)

See the [Schedule and Roadmap]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/success/#time-management-and-scheduling) suggestions. 

In our course, each week covers roughly 1 chapter from zyBooks, so "Week 1" in zyBooks is effectively Chapter 1 and so on.

We have the following course activities that need to be **completed in zyBooks** on a weekly basis: 
* **PA**{: .label .label-orange }(Participation Activities), 
* **CA**{: .label .label-blue }(Challenge Activities), 
* **LA**{: .label .label-green }(Lab Activities).

Additionally, the following weekly activities will need to be completed by going to **Gauchospace**:
* **Quiz**{: .label .label-darkcyan } - will always _start on Gauchospace_, which might redirect you to Gradescope
* **Reflection**{: .label .label-yellow } - will be posted as a link to a Google form
